Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"This Act was enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka to provide a legal framework for the prevention and protection against domestic violence. It establishes mechanisms through which an aggrieved person (victim) can seek legal protection from abusive situations, especially within family relationships. The Act empowers the Magistrate’s Court to issue Protection Orders and Interim Orders to prevent ongoing or potential domestic violence and outlines the rights of victims."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Defines the eligibility criteria for applying for a Protection Order. Any individual who is facing domestic violence or is at risk of it may submit an application to the Magistrate’s Court. The law recognizes victims as ""aggrieved persons"" and ensures their right to seek immediate judicial intervention."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Allows third parties to apply for a Protection Order on behalf of an aggrieved person in special cases. If the victim is a child, the law permits their parent, guardian, caretaker, or an authorized representative from the National Child Protection Authority to file the application. Additionally, a police officer may also apply on behalf of a victim."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Mandates that once an application for a Protection Order is received, the court must immediately review the case. If the Magistrate determines that the victim is in immediate danger, the court can issue an Interim Protection Order (IPO) without waiting for a full hearing. The IPO remains valid until the court completes a thorough investigation into the allegations."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Explains the legal procedure for notifying the accused party (respondent). Once an Interim Protection Order is issued, the court must serve a notice to the respondent informing them of the order and summoning them for a hearing. If the respondent cannot be reached through normal means, alternative methods such as public notification (posting the notice at their residence) may be used to ensure compliance."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"An Interim Order, once issued, has legal power to prohibit the respondent from engaging in any further acts of domestic violence. This includes physical abuse, emotional abuse, coercion, intimidation, and economic control. The court has the authority to impose additional restrictions, such as preventing the respondent from entering the victim’s residence, workplace, or school."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The court can direct social workers, family counselors, or law enforcement officers to monitor compliance with the Interim Order. This is particularly important in cases where the victim is highly vulnerable. In addition, the court may require both the victim and the respondent to attend counseling or rehabilitation programs to help prevent further domestic violence."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"This section establishes that an Interim Order remains in effect until the court officially issues a final Protection Order or revokes the Interim Order. It ensures that the victim remains protected during the legal process and prevents the respondent from engaging in further abuse. If the respondent violates the Interim Order, they may face legal consequences such as fines or imprisonment."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the respondent appears in court on the date specified in the notice under Section 4(3), the court will conduct an inquiry into the application. During this process, the court will review any evidence previously submitted and may accept additional affidavits or oral evidence if deemed necessary. This evidence will form part of the official record of proceedings. The courts goal is to assess whether a Protection Order should be issued to safeguard the aggrieved person."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the respondent does not have legal representation, the court may take specific measures to protect the aggrieved person. These measures may include prohibiting the respondent from directly cross-examining the victim and requiring the respondent to submit questions through the court, which will then relay them accurately to the aggrieved person or witnesses. These steps ensure that the process remains fair while preventing further trauma or intimidation"
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Once the court has completed its inquiry and determined that the aggrieved person requires legal protection, it will issue a Protection Order. This decision is made in accordance with Section 8, which outlines the criteria for issuing such an order. The court considers factors such as the history of domestic violence, the severity of harm, and the likelihood of future harm to the aggrieved person before granting the order."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the respondent appears in court on the specified date and does not deny the alleged acts of violence but also does not object to the issuance of a Protection Order, the court will issue the order without further proceedings. The court will still consider Section 8 to ensure that the order is necessary for the protection of the aggrieved person."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the respondent fails to appear in court on the date specified in the notice issued under Section 4(3), and the court is satisfied that the respondent was properly served with the notice, the court will proceed with the case in their absence. The court will review previously submitted evidence and may also accept additional affidavits or oral testimony from the aggrieved person and other witnesses. This ensures that justice is not delayed due to the respondents absence.'"
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"After reviewing all available evidence, including affidavits and oral statements, if the court determines that the issuance of a Protection Order is necessary to safeguard the aggrieved person, it will issue such an order in accordance with Section 8. The order will specify restrictions on the respondent’s actions to prevent further harm to the victim."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"When deciding whether to issue a Protection Order, the court must take into account the need to prevent further acts of domestic violence and ensure the safety and well-being of the aggrieved person. The court will examine past incidents of violence, the potential risk of future harm, and any psychological, emotional, or economic impact on the victim. The ultimate objective is to provide the necessary legal protection to prevent further abuse."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"Once a Protection Order is issued, the court must ensure that it is effectively communicated to all relevant parties. The order will be formally served to the respondent, and certified copies will be provided to the aggrieved person, the applicant (if different from the victim), and the police officers in charge of the jurisdictions where both the respondent and the victim reside. This ensures proper enforcement and compliance with the order"
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"A Protection Order explicitly prohibits the respondent from engaging in any act of domestic violence against the aggrieved person. In addition to this primary restriction, the court may impose additional prohibitions under Section 11 to further protect the victim from harassment, intimidation, or harm. These prohibitions are tailored to the specific circumstances of each case."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"A Protection Order remains valid for a maximum period of 12 months unless otherwise specified by the court.

The respondent is required to comply with the order throughout its duration, and any violation can result in legal consequences"
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"A Protection Order may include additional prohibitions to prevent further abuse. These may include restrictions on the respondent from entering the victim’s residence, workplace, or school, or from contacting the victim directly or indirectly. The order may also restrict the respondent’s access to shared property, resources, or children involved in the case. These measures are imposed based on the victim’s safety and well-being."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"When determining the scope of the restrictions in a Protection Order, the court will balance the need to protect the aggrieved person with any potential hardship that may arise for the respondent. Consideration will be given to factors such as the need for accommodation, financial dependence, and the welfare of children. However, the primary concern remains the safety and security of the victim."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the court determines that immediate protective measures are necessary, it may issue supplementary orders. These may include directing the police to seize any weapons in the respondent’s possession, arranging police assistance for the victim to retrieve personal belongings, or mandating the respondent to attend rehabilitation or counseling programs. These orders aim to enhance the victim’s safety and provide additional support"
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The court may order the respondent to provide urgent financial assistance to the aggrieved person if the respondent has a legal obligation to support them. This ensures that the victim is not left financially vulnerable due to the separation. However, such an order will be made only after the court conducts an inquiry into the financial capabilities of both parties to ensure fairness."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If the respondent fails to comply with a financial support order, the court has the authority to direct the respondent’s employer to deduct a portion of their salary and transfer it directly to the aggrieved person. This enforcement mechanism ensures that the victim receives the necessary financial support despite the respondent’s non-compliance."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The court may issue an order under this Act with the consent of both parties involved in the proceedings, without requiring proof or an admission of guilt from the respondent. This ensures that protection can be granted swiftly without unnecessary delays. However, such an order shall not be considered an acknowledgment or proof of guilt, nor shall it be used against the respondent in future legal proceedings."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"A Protection Order issued under this Act may be altered, modified, varied, extended, or revoked upon an application made by either the aggrieved person or the respondent. However, the court must be satisfied that there has been a significant change in circumstances to justify such a modification. The order cannot be changed without hearing from both the aggrieved person and the respondent to ensure fairness in the proceedings."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The court shall not alter, modify, or revoke a Protection Order based on the aggrieved person’s application unless it is satisfied that the application has been made freely and voluntarily. This provision prevents undue influence or coercion from affecting the aggrieved persons decision to seek modifications in legal protections."
Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (Chapters V and VI) shall apply in cases where the respondent or witnesses are required to appear before the court.

Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"An appeal does not automatically suspend the Protection Order unless the High Court specifically orders a stay of execution.

Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"If a respondent violates a Protection Order or an Interim Order, they will be guilty of an offense and liable for punishment.

Civil Law,Family Law,Act No. 34,2005,Prevention of Domestic Violence,"The court has the discretion to adopt a suitable procedure for framing charges, rather than strictly following standard procedures outlined in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979.
